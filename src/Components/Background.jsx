      <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
      <p>
        Former <strong>mechanical engineer</strong> with an active secret
        clearance and <strong>8+ years of professional working experience</strong> in team
        oriented roles. Delivered technically sound solutions to restore US Navy
        submarines back to 100% operational condition. <br />
        <br /> I see myself as a <strong>results driven</strong> individual
        where I understand the importance of delivering solutions that meet the
        requirements and expectations. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Fun fact:</strong> When I'm not coding, you'll find me diving
        into the world of lawn care - determined to have the best lawn in the
        neighborhood. It's my little green oasis project beyond the keyboard.
